# Analizing AirBnB insights in Valencia Spain
This project is about to analyze AirBnB data from the city of Valencia in Spain following a CRISP-DM process.
Basically we wanna solve the next 3 questions:

1. What is the relation  between price and other features as number of beds, cleaning fee, number of reviews, cost for extra-people
and accomodates (number of people to occupy the place).

2. What are the most popular locations in the city of Valencia offering AirBnB services and what are the averages prices in these 
locations.

3. Besides of the location what are other important elements that host are offer to improve the visitor comfort expirience, as 
the type of property, room, even type of bed. Additionally we analize also the extras elements names as amenities. 

In the jupyter notebook you will find all the process made to clean the data and obtain the different figures and tables to have 
a better understanding of the data.
